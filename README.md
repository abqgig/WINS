# WINS - The BarelasGig working prototype uses modern
millimeter wave (mmwave) technology to provide fixed wireless gigabit
backhaul and last mile broadband connectivity for a fraction of the cost
of full fiber deployment. This fixed wireless technology now provides
cost effective connectivity in the underserved and economically
disadvantaged community of Barelas just south of downtown
Albuquerque. This technology is robust, weather resistant, and leaps
over many of the obstacles, complexities and costs of laying fiber to
the home or business.
